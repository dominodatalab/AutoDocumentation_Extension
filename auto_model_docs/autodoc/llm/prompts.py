GOVERNANCE_ANTI_FABRICATION = """
- Any model risk classification, validation status, regulatory mapping, approval state, or
  intended-use claim must come VERBATIM from the Governance Evidence block above. Do not infer
  these from code or MLflow. Cite them with [@governance.*]/[@evidence.*].
- When you state or rely on an open finding, cite it with [@finding.*]. Do not invent findings.
- Do not fabricate evidence answers; if a fact is not in the Governance Evidence block, omit it.
- Do not use one source to override or "correct" another. If code and governance evidence
  describe the same attribute differently (e.g. model type, feature count), present BOTH
  with their citations and note the discrepancy explicitly:
  "The code implements XGBoost [@code.x], while the governance record states logistic
  regression [@evidence.model_type]. This discrepancy should be reviewed."
- Do not fabricate a reconciliation. Do not silently choose one source.
- Discrepancies of this kind are significant governance observations, not editorial problems.

Model of record vs development candidates:
- This document may describe several models from the MLflow development history. The governed
  model(s) of record are named in [@governance.model_of_record]. Every governance fact above
  — risk tier, intended use, validation status, approval state, findings — applies ONLY to
  those governed model(s). Never attach a governance fact to any other model.
- The other models are development candidates: experiments and prior versions explored on the
  way to promotion. Document them from code and MLflow evidence only. Do NOT state or imply
  they carry a risk classification, approval, or governance status. Their absence of
  governance data is expected (they were never promoted), not a gap to flag.
- Whenever you state a governance fact and more than one model appears in the document, name
  the governed model(s) explicitly so the reader cannot confuse them with a candidate. For
  example: "The model of record, churn-model v3 [@governance.model_of_record], is classified
  High risk [@governance.risk_tier]." Never write an unattributed "the model is High risk"
  when multiple models appear.

Determine what content blocks this section should contain to create useful documentation.

Content block types available:
- chart: Visual representation (bar, line, or scatter)
- table: Structured data in rows and columns
- narrative: Explanatory paragraphs (2-4 paragraphs)
- bullet_list: Bulleted list of items
- numbered_list: Numbered/ordered list of steps
- image: Embedded MLflow visualization (feature importance plots, confusion matrices, etc.)

CRITICAL: Only plan content blocks that can be generated from the data provided above.
- Do NOT request tables or charts of metrics that are not explicitly listed in the context
- Do NOT request content about cross-validation unless CV metrics are provided
- Do NOT request visualizations of data that doesn't exist
- Do NOT create both a table and chart showing the same data - choose the most effective format
- If limited data is available, plan fewer content blocks focused on what IS known
- For performance metrics: Use "chart" type to visualize numeric metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Use "image" type ONLY when specific image artifacts are listed in the artifacts_info above (e.g., confusion_matrix.png, feature_importance.png)
- If metrics are available but no image artifacts, use "chart" to create bar charts showing metric values
- Do NOT request image artifacts that are not explicitly listed in the artifacts_info above
- For "image" blocks: Include a descriptive "title" in the specifics object that adds context beyond the filename
  (e.g., "Feature Importance - XGBoost Credit Risk Model" instead of just "Feature Importance").
  Include the model name, task context, or relevant metric when available.

Consider what would be most valuable for documenting this section. Prefer visual content (images, charts, tables) when data allows. Include 2-4 content blocks."""

1. If metrics are provided above (e.g., "roc_auc: 0.6903", "precision: 0.2399"), use them as:

   - values: The metric values (e.g., [0.6903, 0.2399, 0.3844, 0.2956])
   - title: A descriptive title like "Model Performance Metrics"

2. For performance charts specifically, focus on test/validation metrics (not training metrics).

3. If feature importance data is provided, create a chart of top features.

CRITICAL: Only visualize data that is explicitly provided above.
Do NOT fabricate or estimate any values. If NO metrics are provided above, return:
- title: ""
- labels: []
- values: []
